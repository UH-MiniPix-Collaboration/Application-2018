\section{In-Flight Failure Contingency Plan}
\label{sec:Failure}
If for some reason the sampling system fails, commands can be uplinked to the control system that allow for subsystem resets. If downlinked data shows extreme overheating or any sort of abnormality that could result in damage to HASP or other payloads, we will shut down all systems through the discrete command provided by HASP.
